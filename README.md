# Professional-Staement

I am enthusiastic about cyber security and believe my strong verbal communication and time management skills can have a positive impact on protecting both organizations and people.  My experience as a frontend operations supervisory leader allows me to have efficient responses while clearly communicating in a calm manner. Currently, Iâ€™m working on my networking and information security skills to become both CompTIA Sec+ and Net+ Certified.
